# Appwrite.Clone
I created a partial frontend clone of an existing website's Program page using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project replicated key sections, including the navigation bar, hero section, program details, image slider, and footer. React managed components, HTML structured the page, CSS styled it, and JavaScript added interactivity.
